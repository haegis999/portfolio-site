<p>  

Hi, I'm Taiwo Akinyemi. I'm a Front end Web Developer with over 6+ years of experiences.

Apart from designing user interface and user experience, I'm also a software developer with tech stacks of languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and Java scripts. </p>

<p>I'm also a multi-talented artist with experiences and passion for wide range of disciplines like graphic design, photography, drawing, tech advisor, blogger, content writer, forex/crypto trading, music, poetry and more. </p>


<p>I'm versatile and a natural problem solver. Being a passionate artist and creator, I'm easily inspired and enthused to work on new projects. I work with boundless enthusiasm and energy and I'm never satisfied until I've gotten the utmost desired result and brought ideas to life.</p> 

<p>Want to work together? I’d love to hear from you.
